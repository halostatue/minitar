# Changelog

## NEXT / 2025-MM-DD

- Documentation:

  - Removed duplicate documentation files and updated the RDoc to match the
    configuration.

## 1.1.0 / 2025-09-07

- Enhancements:

  - Support large file size encoded in base-256 encoding which is a GNU tar
    extension [#121][pull-121].

  - Support large file size encoded in PAX extension header. [#121][pull-121].

- Bug fix:

  - Resolved [#62][issue-62]. The initial solution was developed with the
    assistance of Claude Sonnet 4 via Kiro, but nearly every line of the
    solution and tests were rewritten as part of a comprehensive review of all
    tests.

- Breaking Change:

  - Removed `Minitar::PosixHeader.new_from_stream` which should have been
    removed with 1.0.0 and has been deprecated for a decade or so.

- Governance:

  Changes described below are effective 2024-12-31.

  - Update gem management details to use markdown files for everything, enabled
    in part by [flavorjones/hoe-markdown][hoe-markdown]. Several files were
    renamed to be more consistent with standard practices.

  - Updated security notes with an [age][age] public key rather than pointing to
    Keybase.io and a PGP public key which I no longer use. The use of the
    [Tidelift security contact][tidelift] is recommended over direct disclosure.

  Changes described below are effective 2025-08-04.

  - Contributions to minitar now require a DCO certification.

## 1.0.2 / 2024-08-23

- Bug fix:

  - Minitar 1.0.1 was released with an unchanged gemspec. Reported by Debashish
    Biswas in [#65][issue-65].

## 1.0.1 / 2024-08-08

- Bug fix:

  - Resolve a constant lookup issue. The accepted fix has been provided by Aram
    Price in [#58][issue-58].

## 1.0.0 / 2024-08-07

- Breaking Changes:

  - Minimum Ruby version is 3.1.

  - The `Archive::Tar::Minitar` namespace has been completely removed and
    `Minitar` is a class instead of a module.

- Enhancements:

  - Added `Minitar.pack_as_file`, originally proposed by John Prince back in
    2011 [#7][issue-07].

## 0.12.1 / 2024-08-21

- Reverted adbbb9b596 to restore compatibility with Ruby < 2.0. Resolves
  [#63][issue-63] reported by Robert Schulze.

## 0.12 / 2024-08-06

- Properly handle very long GNU filenames, resolving [#46][issue-46].
- Handle very long GNU filenames that are 512 or more bytes, resolving
  [#45][issue-45]. Originally implemented in [#47][pull-47] by Vijay, but
  accidentally closed.

## 0.11 / 2022-12-31

- symlink support is complete. Merged as PR [#42][pull-42], rebased and built on
  top of PR [#12][pull-12] by fetep.

- kymmt90 fixed a documentation error on `Minitar.pack` in PR [#43][pull-43].

- This version is a soft-deprecation of all versions before Ruby 2.7, as they
  will no longer be tested in CI.

## 0.10 / 2022-03-26

- nevesenin fixed an issue with long filename handling. Merged as PR
  [#40][pull-40].

## 0.9 / 2019-09-04

- jtappa added the ability to skip fsync with a new option to `Minitar.unpack`
  and `Minitar::Input#extract_entry`. Provide `:fsync => false` as the last
  parameter to enable. Merged from a modified version of PR [#37][pull-37].

## 0.8 / 2019-01-05

- [@inkstak](https://github.com/inkstak) resolved an issue introduced in the fix
  for [#31][issue-31] by allowing spaces to be considered valid characters in
  strict octal handling. Octal conversion ignores leading spaces. Merged from a
  slightly modified version of PR [#35][pull-35].

- [@dearblue](https://github.com/dearblue) contributed PR [#32][pull-32]
  providing an explicit call to #bytesize for strings that include multibyte
  characters. The PR has been modified to be compatible with older versions of
  Ruby and extend tests.

- Akinori MUSHA (knu) contributed PR [#36][pull-36] that treats certain badly
  encoded regular files (with names ending in `/`) as if they were directories
  on decode.

## 0.7 / 2018-02-19

- Fixed issue [#28][issue-28] with a modified version of PR [#29][pull-29]
  covering the security policy and position for `Minitar`. Thanks so much to
  [@ooooooo-q](https://github.com/ooooooo-q) for the report and an initial
  patch. Additional information was added as [#30][issue-30].

- [@dearblue](https://github.com/dearblue) contributed PR [#33][pull-33]
  providing a fix for `Minitar::Reader` when the IO-like object does not have a
  `#pos` method.

- Kevin McDermott contributed PR [#34][pull-34] so that an InvalidTarStream is
  raised if the tar header is not valid, preventing incorrect streaming of files
  from a non-tarfile. This is a minor breaking change, so the version has been
  bumped accordingly.

- Kazuyoshi Kato contributed PR [#26][pull-26] providing support for the GNU tar
  long filename extension.

- Addressed a potential DOS with negative size fields in tar headers
  ([#31][issue-31]). This has been handled in two ways: the size field in a tar
  header is interpreted as a strict octal value and the `Minitar` reader will
  raise an InvalidTarStream if the size ends up being negative anyway.

## 0.6.1 / 2017-02-07

- Fixed issue [#24][issue-24] where streams were being improperly closed
  immediately on open unless there was a block provided.

- Hopefully fixes issue [#23][issue-23] by releasing archive-tar-minitar after
  minitar-cli is available.

## 0.6 / 2017-02-07

- Breaking Changes:

  - Extracted `bin/minitar` into a new gem, `minitar-cli`. No, I am _not_ going
    to bump the major version for this. As far as I can tell, few people use the
    command-line utility anyway. (Installing `archive-tar-minitar` will install
    both `minitar` and `minitar-cli`, at least until version 1.0.)

  - `Minitar` extraction before 0.6 traverses directories if the tarball
    includes a relative directory reference, as reported in [#16][issue-16] by
    [@ecneladis](https://github.com/ecneladis). This has been disallowed
    entirely and will throw a `SecureRelativePathError` when found.
    Additionally, if the final destination of an entry is an already-existing
    symbolic link, the existing symbolic link will be removed and the file will
    be written correctly (on platforms that support symbolic links).

- Enhancements:

  - Licence change. After speaking with Mauricio Fernández, we have changed the
    licensing of this library to Ruby and Simplified BSD and have dropped the
    GNU GPL license. This takes effect from the 0.6 release.
  - Printing a deprecation warning for including Archive::Tar to put `Minitar`
    in the top-level namespace.
  - Printing a deprecation warning for including `Archive::Tar::Minitar` into a
    class (`Minitar` will be a class for version 1.0).
  - Moved `Archive::Tar::PosixHeader` to `Archive::Tar::Minitar::PosixHeader`
    with a deprecation warning. Do not depend on
    `Archive::Tar::Minitar::PosixHeader`, as it will be moving to
    `::Minitar::PosixHeader` in a future release.
  - Added an alias, `::Minitar`, for `Archive::Tar::Minitar`, opted in with
    `require 'minitar'`. In future releases, this alias will be enabled by
    default, and the `Archive::Tar` namespace will be removed entirely for
    version 1.0.
  - Modified the handling of `mtime` in `PosixHeader` to do an integer
    conversion (`#to_i`) so that a Time object can be used instead of the
    integer value of the time object.
  - `Writer::RestrictedStream` was renamed to `Writer::WriteOnlyStream` for
    clarity. No alias or deprecation warning was provided for this as it is an
    internal implementation detail.
  - `Writer::BoundedStream` was renamed to `Writer::BoundedWriteStream` for
    clarity. A deprecation warning is provided on first use because a
    BoundedWriteStream may raise a `BoundedWriteStream::FileOverflow` exception.
  - `Writer::BoundedWriteStream::FileOverflow` has been renamed to
    `Writer::WriteBoundaryOverflow` and inherits from `StandardError` instead of
    `RuntimeError`. Note that for Ruby 2.0 or higher, an error will be raised
    when specifying `Writer::BoundedWriteStream::FileOverflow` because
    `Writer::BoundedWriteStream` has been declared a private constant.
  - Modified `Writer#add_file_simple` to accept the data for a file in
    `opts[:data]`. When `opts[:data]` is provided, a stream block must not be
    provided. Improved the documentation for this method.
  - Modified `Writer#add_file` to accept `opts[:data]` and transparently call
    `Writer#add_file_simple` in this case.
  - Methods that require blocks are no longer required, so the
    `Archive::Tar::Minitar::BlockRequired` exception has been removed with a
    warning (this may not work on Ruby 1.8).
  - Dramatically reduced the number of strings created when creating a POSIX
    tarball header.
  - Added a helper, `Input.each_entry` that iterates over each entry in an
    opened entry object.

- Bugs:

  - Fix [#2][issue-02] to handle IO streams that are not seekable, such as
    pipes, `STDIN`, or `STDOUT`.
  - Fix [#3][issue-03] to make the test timezone resilient.
  - Fix [#4][issue-04] for supporting the reading of tar files with filenames in
    the GNU long filename extension format. Ported from
    [@atoulme](https://github.com/atoulme)’s fork, originally provided by Curtis
    Sampson.
  - Fix [#6][issue-06] by making it raise the correct error for a long filename
    with no path components.
  - Fix [#13][issue-13] provided by [@fetep](https://github.com/fetep) fixes an
    off-by-one error on filename splitting.
  - Fix [#14][issue-14] provided by [@kzys](https://github.com/kzys) should fix
    Windows detection issues.
  - Fix [#16][issue-16] as specified above.
  - Fix an issue where `Minitar.pack` would not include Unix hidden files when
    creating a tarball.

- Development:

  - Modernized minitar tooling around Hoe.
  - Added travis and coveralls.
